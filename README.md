# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Overview
This is my first machine learning project, using the classic Kaggle Titanic dataset.  
The goal is to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on features like age, sex, class, and fare.

## Files Included
- titanic.py â€“ Python script created in VS Code for basic model building.
- submission.csv â€“ Predictions generated from the model.

## Dataset
The dataset can be downloaded from the official Kaggle competition:
